# productivity-app

Spring Boot API that communicates with my react app "front-productivity-app" and a MySQL DB

I have develop a registration with an email confirmation, an authentication with JW Tokens (an access token and a refresh token). And it can also be called to perform basic CRUD operations on different entities.
